### Simple guessing game

This app provides:
- You are given the task of guessing the position of a number between 1 to 9 hidden behind a grid of 3x3
- You have 4 attempts
- Behind the grid of 3x3 cells there is a unique number between 1 to 9, without repetitions

The game is quite simople with a grid this ise. Increasing the grid size, it would be much harder to win. To with with larger grids, it is best to follow a strategy. A strategy to win for larger grids is explained here: https://youtu.be/iSNsgj1OCLA
